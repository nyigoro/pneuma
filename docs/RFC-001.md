# RFC-001: Pneuma Architecture and Bootstrapping

Status: Draft

This document captures the initial architecture for Pneuma:
- `pneuma-core` as CLI entry point.
- `pneuma-broker` for engine routing and confidence scoring.
- `pneuma-engines` for Servo/Ladybird abstractions.
- `pneuma-network`, `pneuma-stealth`, `pneuma-js`, and `pneuma-plugin` as supporting layers.

The repository is scaffolded so contributors can run `cargo build` before full engine integration lands.
